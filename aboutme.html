            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>While my academic background has given me strong technical and analytical skills, I believe my passion lies in sales. As a very outgoing person and love for connecting with new people; Which has been a big part of my experience working in the food industry throughout my life. I enjoy understanding people’s needs and providing solutions that make a difference. I’m excited to bring my blend of technical knowledge and people-first approach to a sales role where I can build lasting relationships."</p>
